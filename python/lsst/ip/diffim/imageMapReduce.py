"""Tasks for processing an exposure via processing on
multiple sub-exposures and then collecting the results
to either re-stitch the sub-exposures back into a new
exposure, or return summary results for each sub-exposure.

This provides a framework for arbitrary mapper-reducer
operations on an exposure by implementing simple operations in
subTasks. It currently is not parallelized, although it could be in
the future. It does enable operations such as spatially-mapped
processing on a grid across an image, processing regions surrounding
centroids (such as for PSF processing), etc.

It is implemented as primary Task, `ImageMapReduceTask` which contains
two subtasks, `ImageMapper` and `ImageReducer`.
`ImageMapReduceTask` configures the centroids and sub-exposure
dimensions to be processed, and then calls the `run` methods of the
`ImageMapper` and `ImageReducer` on those sub-exposures.
`ImageMapReduceTask` may be configured with a list of sub-exposure
centroids (`config.cellCentroidsX` and `config.cellCentroidsY`) and a
single pair of bounding boxes defining their dimensions, or a set of
parameters defining a regular grid of centroids (`config.gridStepX`
and `config.gridStepY`).

`ImageMapper` is an abstract class and must be subclassed with
an implemented `run` method to provide the desired operation for
processing individual sub-exposures. It is called from
`ImageMapReduceTask.run`, and may return a new, processed sub-exposure
which is to be "stitched" back into a new resulting larger exposure
(depending on the configured `ImageMapReduceTask.mapper`);
otherwise if it does not return an lsst.afw.image.Exposure, then the results are
passed back directly to the caller.

`ImageReducer` will either stitch the `mapperResults` list of
results generated by the `ImageMapper` together into a new
Exposure (by default) or pass it through to the
caller. `ImageReducer` has an implemented `run` method for
basic reducing operations (`reduceOperation`) such as `average` (which
will average all overlapping pixels from sub-exposures produced by the
`ImageMapper` into the new exposure). Another notable
implemented `reduceOperation` is 'none', in which case the
`mapperResults` list is simply returned directly.

        -----
        1. This currently correctly handles overlapping sub-exposures.
           For overlapping sub-exposures, use `config.reduceOperation='average'`.
        2. This correctly handles varying PSFs, constructing the resulting
           exposure's PSF via CoaddPsf (DM-9629).

        Known issues
        ------------
        1. To be done: correct handling of masks (nearly there)
        2. This logic currently makes *two* copies of the original exposure
           (one here and one in `mapper.run()`). Possibly of concern
           for large images on memory-constrained systems.

    Perform 'simple' operations on a gridded set of subExposures of a

    stitched back together into a new, full-sized image.

    Contrary to the expectation given by its name, this task does not

    divided, and those subExposures will be passed to the subTasks,
    along with the original exposure. The reducing operation is
